			Dr. Wadie was born and grew up in Baghdad, Iraq; Since she was young, she aspired to work as a health professional and realized that dream in 1985 when she got her Bachelors of Dental Surgery. She immediately began working at dental offices to gain experience. She worked very hard, and the dentists she worked for became her mentors; today she routinely does things the old fashioned way in order to keep patient service her top priority.<br/><br/>In 1990, Dr. Wadie came to the United States and was required to get an American Dental License. So, in 1994, she graduated from the University of Detroit Mercy Dental School and worked thereafter as a clinical instructor until 1996. Then, she opened her first private practice in Farmington Hills, on 13 Mile Rd. She learned English, and speaks it fluently along with Arabic and Chaldean - her native tongues. She worked in that building until 2009, when she relocated to the Dental Spot on Northwestern Hwy.<br/><br/>Dr. Wadie believes strongly in community service. From 1998-2008, she was part of the Oakland County Assistance Program, which offers free service to the underserved members of the community. In 2000 she joined the Project Bismutha Iraqi Refugee program, which offers free service for the Iraqi refugees, and is also a member of the Chaldean American Ladies of Charity. In 2012, she began working at the St. Vincent de Paul Dental Clinic. <br/><br/> Dr. Wadie's office is very kid friendly. Due to her love of kids, she established a 'Dental Field Day' at a local elementary school. Through Dental Field Day, Dr. Wadie offered MMC students at the Maria Montessori Center (Farmington Hills) in-office dental health and nutritional education annually from 2001-present.
